        William Wallace LI had a vision, one that came from the words of his honorable ancestor, William Wallace I, who once said," Every man dies. But not everyone gets to live smelling fresh." With those words, he believed that every person should have the privilege to smell like a proper Scot. With the help of his dear friends Freya Morrigan and Jeff Holmes, he can fulfill his dream in 2014. He had named the store after one of Scotland's famous urban legends: the Loch Ness Monster.

        During his time in the United States, Mr. Wallace had applied for a position at a U.S-based soap company "Dr. Squatch". Unfortunately, his application was declined for an undisclosed reason. Taking this rejection of his application to heart, Mr. Wallace LI decided to make his own soap company to spite Dr. Squatch for rejecting his application. Even the name was an obvious parody of Dr. Squatch, with "Prof. Nessie's Apothecary".

      1. Before going into finances, Jeff wanted to become a math teacher for high schoolers. Unfortunately, Jeff discovered two things: 1. He hates math. 2. He hates high schoolers.
     2. Freya Morrigan was named after the Vanir goddess Freya from Norse Mythology. The name means "noble lady". In Norse Mythology, Freya was also the queen of the Valkyries, a group of winged-warrior women who would help guide those who died in battle into Valhalla.
     3. Although he prefers to go by "Will" for short, William dislikes being called "Willy" due to an incident involving him falling into an orca aquarium as a kid.
